#Revisr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExpandedFronts/revisr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ExpandedFronts/revisr) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/ExpandedFronts/revisr/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/ExpandedFronts/revisr/?branch=master)

##Description##

Revisr allows you to manage your WordPress website with a Git repository. With Revisr, you can:

* Track changes to your entire WordPress installation, or just the parts that you prefer
* Commit changes from within the WordPress dashboard
* Backup or restore your entire website in seconds
* Set up daily or weekly automatic backups
* Optionally push or pull changes to a remote repository, like Bitbucket or Github.
* Test changes out before deploying them
* Revert your website files and/or database to an earlier version
* Quickly discard any unwanted changes

A must have plugin for deploying and managing WordPress using Git repositories.

## Installation ##

### Requirements ###

* A web server with Git and WordPress installed
* The PHP exec() function enabled

### Instructions ###

* Unzip the plugin folder and upload it to the plugins directory of your WordPress installation.
* If the WordPress installation is not already in a Git repository, you will be prompted to initialize a new one.
* Configure the plugin settings.

### Notes ###
Please verify that database backups are working before attempting to revert the database, especially if attempting to do so on a production website. Backups use the mysqldump command, supported by most hosts/environments.

If you're using the HTTPS method to connect to the remote repository, the password for the remote repository will be stored in the '.git/config' file. You should take steps to prevent this from being publicly accessible. The following code added to a '.htaccess' file in the '.git/' directory will prevent public access:

`
content: Deny from all
`

If you're using NGINX, you'll have to update your configuration file with something similar to the following:

`
location ~ path/to/your-repo/.git {
        deny  all;
}
`

This issue can be avoided entirely by using SSH to authenticate, which is recommended in most cases. If using SSH, you will need to generate a SSH key on the server and add it to the remote repository (Bitbucket and Github both support SSH).

You should also make sure that the .sql backup files aren't publicly accessible. You can do this in Apache by adding the folling to your .htaccess file in the document root:

`
<FilesMatch "\.sql">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
</FilesMatch>
`
If you're using NGINX, something similar to the below should work:
`
location ~ \.sql { deny all; }
`

It is also adviseable to add Revisr to the gitignore file via the settings page to make sure that reverts don't rollback the plugins' functionality.
